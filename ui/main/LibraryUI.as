They usually gather in small tribes and waylay travellers on the road but large camps have been known to raid villages, stealing sheep and babies.  Goblins are fast and agile, striking quickly and deftly avoiding blows.<page>There are three types of Goblins: Forest, Mountain and Cave.  Forest Goblins are more cunning than their counterparts, striking with great precision.  Mountain Goblins are hardier than the others, a necessity in the harsh rocky environment.  Cave Goblins are stronger than their counterparts and Cave Goblin Shamans wield the power of Darkness.<page><sub>Goblin Fighter</sub><img:enemy:00>\nOffensive: Medium\nDefensive: Medium\nSpecial: None\nD Type: Physical\n\nGoblin Fighters and melee combatants whose main talent is sword swinging.<page>Most male goblins become fighters, attacking their enemies head on with crude weaponry pilfered from their prey.  They attack with very little skill or prowess, instead relying on muscles and viciousnessto kill people and drag them home for eating.<page><sub>Goblin Brute</sub><img:enemy:01>\nOffensive: Medium\nDefensive: Low\nSpecial: Medium\nD Type: Physical\n\nBrutes fight with their fists and can buff themselves with magic.<page>The biggest goblins grow up to be jerks and bullies, mastering the traditional arts of Wedgies and Swirlies, among others.  The jerkiest and bullyingest goblins are taken into the sacred order of The Brute where they learn the ancient goblin martial art of 'Bashum Gud'.  This art combines punches with boosting magic to make an  even jerkier bully.<page><sub>Goblin Shaman</sub><img:enemy:02>\nOffensive: Low\nDefensive: Low\nSpecial: Very High\nD Type: Magical/Dark\n\nGoblin Shamans have spells which weaken and damage their foes.<page>Goblins are a superstitious lot, believing in all kinds of strange things.  For example, they regularly smear pidgeon poop on their foreheads in order to give them good luck and spin around in circles before going to the bathroom.  Shamans are masters of these superstitions and get a great laugh out of inventing new silly ones and making their  clanmates do them.<page><sub>Goblin Alchemist</sub><img:enemy:03>\nOffensive: Low\nDefense: Medium\nSpecial: High\nD Type: Chemical\n\nGoblin Alchemists throw either Alchemist Fire or Poison Gas potions.<page>Them women of the goblin tribes are incredibly ugly, so much so that normally no goblin male would ever touch them.  Because of this the women had to master the art of alchemy so that they could drug their men into marrying them.  They have developed the art of potion making for combat purposes as well and throw potions at their enemies with deadly effect.<page><sub>Vine</sub><img:enemy:04>\nOffensive: High\nDefensive: Low\nSpecial: Medium\nD Type: Physical\n\nVines attack with deadly accuracy and have special attack properties.<page>Goblins keep a lot of strange herbs and spices around to make their people stews taste better.  One of their favorite is the Pumpler Vine which adds a musky bitter flavour reminiscent of a combination between deer feces and baboon sweat.  The pumpler vine also happens to be quite violent and just as many of them eat goblins as goblins  eat them.<page><sub>Blob</sub><img:enemy:05>\nOffensive: Medium\nDefensive: Medium\nSpecial: None\nD Type: Chemical\n\nBlobs attack with chemical ooze and are difficult to hit.<page>Goblins keep these cute little blobs as pets.  They are corrosive to the touch and like to eat metal, clothing and trinkets.  They get along great with goblins, who feed them all the equipment that their dinners were carrying on them.  In exchange, blobs help out with the hunt by squirting themselves all over travellers and entertain goblins by  hopping about cutely and getting bashed into a squishy and satisfying mess.<page><sub>Goblin Chief</sub><img:boss :00>\nOffensive: High\nDefensive: High\nSpecial: Medium\n\nGoblin Chiefs strike hard and can take a heavy beating.  Their shield bash is powerful.<page>The chief of a goblin tribe is chosen based on girth.  It is thought that the fatter a goblin is the more he will love to eat, and the more he will love to eat the more food he will strive to bring into the tribe.  Also, tribal shamans tell people that the fatter a person is the more supernatural awesomeness a person has and that supernatural awesomeness makes for a good leader.<page><title>Beasts</title>\nIn the world exist many peaceful creatures who want nothing more than to frolic and play among the verdant forests and pleasant valleys.  They romp and roam frivolously without a care in the  world and have a great love of harmony and tranquility.  The beasts are not these creatures.\n\nThe beasts exist only for violence and destruction, tearing down villages and<page>eating livestock, spreading mayhem wherever they roam.\n\nThere are three kinds of beasts: Savage, Dire and Dark.  All of them are resistant to magic and very strong.  The Savage Beasts are faster than the others, striking quickly and without remorse. Dire beasts are stronger, attacking with venomous ire.  Dark beasts are ferocious and malific, capable of even greater blows. <page><sub>Rhino</sub><img:enemy:11>\nOffensive: Medium\nDefensive: High\nSpecial: Low\nD Type: Physical\n\nRhinos are heavy hitters and can work themselves into a frenzied rage.<page>Rhinos are dumb brutes who look at the world as a bunch of different objects whose sole uses are being smashed into bits.  Rhinos like to facilitate this smashing as much as they can.  Some people used to hunt rhinos for their valuable tusks.  Those people aren't alive any more.<page><sub>Tiger</sub><img:enemy:12>\nOffensive: High\nDefensive: Medium\nSpecial: None\nD Type: Physical\n\nTigers attack with great power and accuracy.<page>The ancient sabertoothed tiger was said to be the most vicious and maltempered creature who ever lived.  The modern sabertoothed tiger is much the same.  These wild animals munch on cute little critters five times a day and spend the rest of their time knocking down trees and chewing up fences, giving farmers and beavers a really  hard time.<page><sub>Wolf</sub><img:enemy:14>\nOffensive: Medium\nDefensive: Medium\nSpecial: None\nD Type: Physical\n\nWolves strike quickly and are highly resistant.<page>The little wolves seem cute and cuddly but really they aren't.  In fact, they don't even seem that way.  They're not that tough and not even that bright, but they can move very quickly and they are resistant special attacks.  You don't want to back them into a corner because that's when they get vicious.  You also don't want to let them roam  free because that's when they get really vicious.  Basically, you don't want to be around them.<page><sub>Dragon</sub><img:enemy:10>\nOffensive: Medium\nDefensive: Medium\nSpecial: Medium\nD Type: Varies\n\nDragons attack with their breath weapons and magical spells.<page>Dragons were once benevolent creatures who were at peace with the world around them.  Then they discovered they were bigger and stronger than the world around them and started destroying it.  They kept doing so ever since.  Savage dragons burn up everything around them, dire dragons spread plague and disease while dark dragons blast everything with their dark breath.<page><sub>Whelp</sub><img:enemy:13>\nOffensive: Medium\nDefensive: Medium\nSpecial: Low\nD Type: Physical\n\nYounger dragons bite viciously with a burst of power.<page>Young dragons are called Whelps.  This is because when people see them they say 'Whelp, I guess we're done for!'  Their breath weapons aren't yet fully mature but they still send out a little burst of power with each attack.  Also, whelp scales are very resistant to their particular element.  Nobody knows why this resistance fades with age but it is mostly attributed to the necessity for balance in the world.<page><sub>Mega Boar</sub><img:boss :01>\nOffensive: High\nDefensive: High\n \Special: Medium\nD Type: Physical\n\nThe Mega Boar attacks with speed and has deadly toxic spines.<page>Most are under the impression that the Lion is King of the Beasts.  Those who believe this have never met the Mega Boar.  This powerful and vicious creature has a violent temper and sour disposition which means that he has very little friends.  The Mega Boar doesn't like this, which just makes him more sour and angry. Unfortunately for any heroes who happen upon him, the Mega Boar has no problems with taking his anger out on others.<page><title>Demons</title>\nThere is a realm of demonic entities which exists parallel to this world, containing nothing but evil and cruel beings who have a love for mischief, destruction and other bad things. Occasionally the come out into the world to spread their evilness but mostly they are content with remaining at home and just being bad to each other.  Of course, if anyone comes to visit them they will try their best to be bad hosts... and<page>I don't mean by serving cold tea and stale crumpets!\n\nThere are three kinds of Demons: Hellish, Plasmic and Spectral.  As creatures of magic all of them have the ability to dispel it.  Hellish Demons deal a burst of potent magic on critical hits.  Plasmic ones add Magic damage on every hit.  Spectral ones add Dark damage on every hit.<page><sub>Imp</sub><img:enemy:20>\nOffensive: Low\nDefensive: Low\nSpecial: High\nD Type: Physical\n\nImps are creatures of magic<page>Imps are tiny flying balls of teeth and claws who like to use said teeth and claws on pretty much anything.  More than that they like to use their magical powers on pretty much anything.  Their favorite targets are chair legs, supporting beams or other important structural things which they delight in seeing crumble so that people or buildings fall on their butts dramatically.  Their second favorite targets are so called 'heroes'.<page><sub>Helling</sub><img:enemy:21>\nOffensive: High\nDefensive: Low\nSpecial: Low\nD Type: Chemical\n\nHellings are swift spikey killers<page>Hellings (pronounced Hell-Lings) live in the dumpy cluttered areas of the demonic realm where other demons throw their garbage and the half eaten corpses or kidnapped humans.  In these areas Hellings have built kingdoms with a higherarchy of leaders and judges to dole out a complicated set of laws and judgements in order to better serve their mini societies.<page><sub>Golem</sub><img:enemy:22>\nOffensive: High\nDefensive: High\nSpecial: None\nD Type: Physical\n\nGolems are strong, slow and stupid.<page>Some may call Golems stupid.  Those people are themselves stupid.  This is because Golems don't actually have brains, one of the requirements for stupidity, which is defined as a poorly working brain.  In their off hours, golems just stand around doing nothing, staring off into space with their single eye glazed over.  In their on hours they do exactly the same thing.<page><sub>Flambert</sub><img:enemy:23>\nOffensive: High\nDefensive: Medium\nSpecial: None\nD Type: Magical/Dark\n\nFlamberts are swift burning strikers.<page>The greatest mystery of the demonic realm is how these creatures keep burning.  They don't eat anything, since anything they try to eat gets burned up long before it even gets close to their mouths.  Despite this they keep trying to eat, even though the same thing happens each time.  Scientists have concluded that these creatures must always be plagued by an unnecessary hunger.<page><sub>Skeleton</sub><img:enemy:24>\nOffensive: Medium\nDefensive: High\nSpecial: None\nD Type: Physical\n\nDead things which are hard to kill again.<page>Skeletons used to be human and still are in shape, without the flesh that accompanies living things.  Their state of being dead means they don't have any desires or thoughts making them perfect soliders.  Unfortunately since they don't have ears it's really hard to tell them what to do.  Since they are already dead, killing them again is extremely difficult.  In fact, it should be impossible but where would the fairness in that be?<page><sub>Beezelpuff</sub><img:boss :02>\nOffensive: Medium\nDefensive: High\nSpecial: High\nD Type: Dark\n\nBeings of pure evil and darkness.<page>The king of all demons is named Beezelbuz.  His favored pet is the creature called 'Beezelpuff', which the vain king named after himself.  These puffy creatures are filled with darkness, so much so that it oozes out of their very pores in an evil stench that can be smelled from half a mile away by a skunk with a cold submerged underwater.";
				case 2:return "<title>Warrior Tree</title>\nEvery adventurer, whether a warrior or a wizard, needs to have at least a token amount of Physical training.  Without even a minor improvement to health it is possible for a lucky shot to kill the adventurer outright.  Warriors take this theory to the extreme make physical training the entirety of their skillset.\n\nRangers and Monks often train as Warriors to improve their fighting<page>abilities, while Wizards and Alchemists may dip their toes in to compensate for their lack of natural defensive abilities.<page><img:skill:02><sub>Fitness</sub>\nImproves:\nStrength,\nHealth\n\nIt is important for every person, young and old, to keep in a good physical shape.  Not everyone needs to be buff and brutish but at least not scrawny and gangly.  Besides the fact that you won't feel as energetic, the ladies don't like scrawny and gangly men.<page><img:skill:00><sub>Strength</sub>\nImproves:\nStrength,\nCritical\nMultiplier\n\nWarriors need to be big and strong in order to deal the most amount of damage with their weapons.  This skill represents advanced brutishness training and power exercises meant to improve just that.<page><img:skill:01><sub>Leap</sub>\nGrants:\nLeap\n\nWhen you walk towards your opponent they can see you coming.  When you jump towards them, especially if you do so with a great battle cry, they'll still see you coming but usually not until it's too late.  Use this skill to close the gap between yourself and wusses who run away.<page><img:skill:04><sub>Weapon Skill</sub>\nImproves:\nInitiative\nHit Rate,\nBlock\n\nAll heroes carry a weapon with them, even wussy wizards, and can benefit from knowing how better to use it.  This skill shines when trained by an actual fighter for it improves the finesse with which he dispatches his foes.<page><img:skill:03><sub>Toughness</sub>\nImproves:\nHitpoints,\nHealth Regen\n\nEvery hero will inevitably get hit by something, be it the swing of an enemy's sword while in combat or an unseen tree branch while lost in thought.  This skill improves your ability to take these blows and also to recover from them more quickly.<page><page><title>Monk Tree</title><page><page><img:skill:05><sub>Unarmed</sub><page><img:skill:06><sub>Flurry of Blows</sub>\nGrants:\nQuick\nStrike\n\nSays Twick the Hunter 'Slow warriors attack slowly.  Fast warriors attack quickly.'  This skill gives you a chance to make an additional normal attack after a successful first attack with a higher hit rate.<page><img:skill:07><sub>Ki Strike</sub><page><img:skill:08><sub>Purity of Body</sub><page><img:skill:09><sub>Defensive Throw</sub>\nGrants:\nDefensive\nThrow\n\nThe best offense is a good defense.  Or is it the best defense is a good offense?  Well, in this case it's the first one.  If you manage to block or dodge an attack you use your superior judo skills to knock your enemy off balance and stun him so that you can do more stuff.<page><page><title>Wizard Tree</title>\nBeyond the veil of physical reality lies a wonderous mystical plane of existance which contains within it infinite wisdom and wonderful enlightenment.  This beautiful and innocent place can be harnessed and corrupted in order to bring down wrathful destruction upon the harnesser's enemies.\n\nMagical skills are only necessary for dedicated wizards who wish to wield<page>magic more effectively.  Some warriors may wish to dabble in the mystic arts in order to grant them more buffing or cursing spells or afford themselves some kind of defense against magic.<page><img:skill:12><sub>Magical Aptitude</sub>\nImproves:\nMagic Power,\nMana\n\nMost people in this world suck at magic, so much so that they can barely use it.  In order to better wield the unseen forces one must spend countless hours in study and meditation openning one's perceptions of reality and accepting the possibility for wonderous feats to occur.<page><img:skill:13><sub>Focus</sub>\nImproves:\nMagic Power\nMagic Rate\n\nWithout constant awareness and concentration, the energy floes weaving their way around us are easy to lose sight of.   Improving one's focus increases the intensity and frequency with which this power can be wielded.<page><img:skill:11><sub>Vessel</sub> \nImproves:\nMana,\nMana Regen\n\nSays Bosun the Wise 'A full vessel can contain little water, but an empty vessel can contain much.'  The greatest key to increasing one's reserves of power is unburdening yourself of emotional baggage and clearing your bowels of unwanted excrement.<page><img:skill:10><sub>Turning</sub>\nImproves:\nTurn Rate\n\n\nWith intense concentration it is possible to see the floes of magic coming down before a wizard even calls them to manifest.  With this incredible ability it is possible to preempt an enemy's casting and turn the floes aside, effectively nullifying the spell.<page><img:skill:14><sub>Attunement</sub>\nImproves:\nResist:\n Magic,\n Dark\n\nBy fully clearing the body's energy channels of unwanted gunk it is possible to allow destructive magic to pass through and leave the body unscathed.  The problem with this technique is it is very difficult to test.<page><page><title>Awareness Tree</title>\nDumb brutes charge into battle headlong, swinging wildly and hoping for victory.  Though it can be effective, there is a better way.  So says Twick the Hunter 'If you see what you're doing you'll do it better.'  This tree contains skills which can improve your offensive and defensive capabilities as well as allow you to find better items.\n\nRangers need to be swift and precise in<page>order to deal maximum damage and get out of the way, but anyone can benefit from the increase in item finding.<page><img:skill:17><sub>Spot</sub>\nImproves:\nCrit Rate,\nItem Find\n\nSo says Twick the Hunter 'When you use your eyes you see more.'  Truly, being able to see clearly is the most important skill for a ranger to possess.  This skill allows you to see the weak spots of your opponents and pick out any items which are strewn about you.<page><img:skill:16><sub>Precision</sub>\nImproves:\nCrit Rate,\nCrit Mult\n\nBeing able to find the weak spots is all well and good, but what you do after finding them is equally important.  This skill allows you to hone in to the exact right place extremely precisely, as the name of this skill suggests, and hit it for the greatest possible oompf!<page><img:skill:18><sub>Battle Awareness</sub>\nImproves:\nBlock,\nDodge\n\nIt's great to kill things, but it's also important to not be killed.  That's where this skill comes in.  By being hyper aware of everything going on around you it makes it much easier to get out of the way or push things aside or dodge bullets if guns existed or whatever else.<page><img:skill:09><sub>Withdraw</sub>\nGrants:\nWithdraw\n\n\nThis is a favoured skill for wusses everywhere.  It lets you back off to a safe distance in order to protect you from those big hulking warriors who are bent on bashing your skull in.  Archers additionally benefit from an increased Hit Rate on their next attack.<page><img:skill:15><sub>Vital Strike</sub>\nGrants:\nCrit Rate\nCrit Mult\n\nSays Twick the Hunter, 'Stronger hits kill better'.  This awesome skill helps you spot the bloodiest veins and most vulnerable organs that you can hit hard and cause to explode in a shower of innards.  Since the graphical effect is still G-rated it won't look so gruesome.<page><page><title>Alchemy Tree</title>\nAlchemy was invented by the great scientist 'Gambabuchu'.  His given name was Steve, but later decided to change it because Gambabuchu sounded cooler.  He called the art he invented 'Destroyination'.  Though later alchemists follow his calculations and techniques to the letter they don't follow his naming schemes.\n\nEvery character can benefit from<page>defensive alchemical techniques for the benefits they provide to health and boosting power, and because they save money on store bought potions by making them.  Only devoted alchemists will want to take the deadlier skills.<page><img:skill:22><sub>Iron Gut</sub>\nImproves:\nPotion Effect,\nPotion Rate\n\nBy injesting lots and lots of disgusting things you have trained your stomach to better realize what is good for it and what is not.  Because of this all potions you drink have an improved effect.  And because you're used to the taste you drink them more often.<page><img:skill:20><sub>Brew Healing Potion</sub>\nGrants:\nPotion Crafting\n\nThis skill allows you to create two different potions: Rabadabadu and Grubblesnuff, or as they are now known: Health and Mana.  As your skills increase you make better and better potions and you work faster and faster.<page><img:skill:21><sub>Brew Buffing Potion</sub>\nGrants:\nPotion Crafting\n\nThe Afraganada potion, or 'Buffing Potion' as it is now known fills you up with incredible strength and power, making you better at pretty much everything you do.  Side effects may include fever, nausea, strange rashes, high blood pressure, happy feet, twitching, ululation and death.<page><img:skill:24><sub>Deadly Alchemist</sub>\nImproves:\nThrow Effect\nThrow Rate\n\nMost people don't realize that there is an art to throwing potions.  It's true that just tossing it at your opponent may cause some damage but those who know what they're doing also... um... well... I don't know what they do, but somehow they throw them a lot better.<page><img:skill:23><sub>Brew Throwing Potion</sub>\nGrants:\nPotion Crafting\n\nThis skill lets you craft the Wowza, Bahahahaha and Holy Sh- potions, or Alchemist Fire, Toxic Gas and Holy without the Sh- potions as they are now known.  Why anyone in their right minds would want to make them while walking is beyond me but they're your eyebrows, not mine!";

Here are some rules of Advancement:\n\n- The maximum level that can be achieved is 60\n\n- Leveling grants you a single skill point and no more.  Including the one you <page>started with, that leaves you with a total of 60 skill points\n\n- One can keep adventuring past level 60 in order to acquire better equipment\n\n- The maximum level for equipment is 15\n\n- Equipment is found at around 1/10 the level of the area exploring.  Shops also sell equipment of about this level<page>- There are three scripted encounters in the game which each give you a unique item based on the type of character you have built\n\n- Skills are capped at level 10 and can never be taken beyond this number\n\n- The chance that a found item is magical is the same as the chance to find the item<page><page><title>Attacking</title>\nSince fighing seems to be the main purpose of this world it is only fitting that it should be described first:\n\n- Weapon Attacks, Projectiles and Potions can be Dodged.\n\n- Dodging is a straight chance of the person avoiding such an attack.<page>- Weapon Attacks and Projectiles can be blocked\n\n- Blocking works on a formula, which is (Attacker Hitrate/(Attacker Hitrate + Defender Block/3))%\n\n- When Hitrate and Block are equal there is a 75% chance to hit\n\n- When Hitrate is double Block there is an 86% chance to hit.<page>- Magic, coming from spells or scrolls, can be Turned\n\n- Turning is a straght chance of the person dispelling such an attack\n\n- Damage dealt is equal to [Item Damage] x [Relevant Stat\n- Thrown weapons only add half of your strength score to damage<page><page><title>Monsters</title>\n\nThis world was created with much evil in it.  The purpose of evil is (1) to be destroyed and (2) help us to grow through the process of destroying it.  The primary manifestation of evil in this world is Monsters.\n\n- The monsters you encounter will start out weak but they will quickly grow strong<page>- Monsters continue to advance in level based on the area you are in, even after you have stopped advancing\n\n- Eventually evil will become too strong and you will no longer be able to advance.  This is inevitable.\n\n- Some monsters have random abilities so even if they look the same they may not be.<page><title>Dueling</title>\n\nThough it is outside the purpose of advancement, Dueling can help to prove how much you have advanced and give a bit of pocket change.\n\n- Duels can only last a certain number of rounds.  Once the time is up the duel ends in a draw<page>- Gold is only gained the first time you defeat a Challenge Opponent\n\n- Holy Damage is also resisted by Dark Resistance\n\n- All usable items used within a duel are returned after the duel ends\n\n- Any changes made to your character within the dueling arena's edit screen are reverted after you leave.  Thus it is<page>possible to test various builds in the duel before comitting\n\n- If you think you have made the ultimate dueling build then check the website www.unknown.com for potential opponents and tournament applications.<page><page><title>Miscellaneous</title>\n\nThe following is a collection of other information which does not fit in a previous category:\n\n- Healing spells and potions are only used when you are either below the healing value or below 25%"
				case 5: return "<title>The Highest Power</title>\nEverything in existance from the outer realms to this one were originated from The Highest Power, a being beyond thought and consciousness.  Though He is the prime cause of this world, in order to facilitate its creation The Highest Power chose His best servants, called 'The Divine Host', to bring it into manifestation.  The following are these.<page><page><title>Yermiyah The Peasant</title>\nYermiyah heard the call of greatness early in life.  It began with visions and thoughts on mechanics but the call to manifest them grew continually until he was forced to learn the art of 'programming' in order to bring them into existence.  Through his genius this world was designed programmed but his lack of artistic abilities forced him to seek others to weave its surface. <page><page><title>Juliette the Savior</title>\nJuliette is a blessed soul from a far away realm.  Full of infinite patience and great talent, she is responsible for reweaving all that exists in her own manner, improving upon the works of Yue and Luca as well as finishing off what they left untouched.  Without Juliette the world would only exist as a mangled pile of grossness and baseness with no positive form whatsoever.<page><page><title>Yue The Weaver</title>\nYue has devoted his life to the creation of lower realms and, in his relatively short years, has facilitated the creation of many.  His skills lie in the creation and innovation of creatures and places, including their appearances and the ways in which they move and interact, as well as the interfaces for other divine beings who interact with this world.  Alas, Yue disappeared from the realm which is why Juliette was able to join.<page><page><title>Luca The Dabbler</title>\nLuca is a brave soul, born in the outer realms but has always lived his life within various inner realms.  His talents lie in conceptualizing and visualizing as well as creation on the surface level and in this world he is responsible for many different things, including much of the inner mechanics, weaving visual effects and ensuring the quality of this world remains high.<page><page><title>Stephan The Swift</title>\nStephan is a young soul with great potential lying within.  He is known for his kindness and humility and makes a great effort to ensure that his creations exist at the highest standard.  Stephan's role in this world is that of the bard, creating beautiful music which accompanies those who explore this world, inspiring them to succeed in their endeavours.";
